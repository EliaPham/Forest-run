# Forest Run
  (https://github.com/EliaPham/Forest-run)

## Description
  The program will run a game in another window where you run on as long as you can without bumping into an object/entity. This relevant to digital arts & media as I will need to create sprites to use in the game, meaning that this project combines both art and coding to make one cohesive game.

## Features
  ### Using the space key to jump
  Connecting the event of pressing down on the spaceboard and linking it to make the sprite chracter and
  change it on the y axis gradually
  ### Pressing the down arrow to duck
  Connecting the event of pressing down on the down arrow key and linking it to change the sprite chracter to
  another image of the character in a different "ducking" pose (changing the animation images)
  ### Putting sprites it the game that will move/be animated
  Using Pygame to link images in a certain order of a loop to give off the illusion of motion/animation
  ### Keeping update of a score
  Displaying the text wih pygame in the corner and updating it with correlation to the run time of the game
  up until the character dies
  ### Death screen popping up when interaction with entity 
  As soon as the sprite charcter interacts with a different sprite, it should end the game and switch it to a
  new screen by using an if statement. I can use pygame's shapes to make the screen as well.

## Challenges
  - How to add spites into a game
  - How to implement the event function of pressing a key down
  - Switching up the screenwhenever an event happens

## Outcomes
  ### Ideal Outcome
  The ideal outcome would be to have very detailed sprites and backgrounds as well. I also want to add four 
  different types of obstacles/entities as in logs and snails for ground objects/entities. Then poision ivy
  and birds for air objects/entities. I also want to add a new high score screen if I can that will
  congradulate the playerwhenthey get a new highscore. Also having the neccessary codeto make the game work
  (like running, jumping, ducking, score tracking, and kill screen)
  ### Minimal Viable Outcome
  The minimal viable outcome would be to have minimal detailed sprites (just as long as one can tell what
  the object/scene/entity is. I also would at least one two different obstacles/entities. Snails for the
  ground and birds for the air objects/entities. If I can't get a new high score screen up and running, then
  I would at least like to show the text saying what the highest score is. Also having the neccessary code
  to make the game work (like running, jumping, ducking, score tracking, and kill screen)

## Milestones
  - **Week 1:** Have the sprites finished and drawn by *April 21, 2025*
  - **Week 2:** Setting up the inital code (sprite characters uploaded, game window set, and running
    animation implemented) by *April 28, 2025*
  - **Week 3:** Having the jumping and ducking animation done as well as adding in the setting/environment
    by *May 5, 2025*
  - **Week 4:** Adding in the obstacles/entites and coding their interactions with deathscreens (like the
    reset button and start buttons) by *May 12, 2025*
