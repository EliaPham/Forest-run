# Forest Run
  (https://github.com/EliaPham/Forest-run)

## Description
  The program will run a game in another window where you run on as long as you can without bumping into an object/entity. This relevant to digital arts & media as I will need to create sprites to use in the game, meaning that this project combines both art and coding to make one cohesive game.

## Features
  ### - Using the space key to jump
  Connecting the event of pressing down on the spaceboard and linking it to make the sprite chracter and
  change it on the y axis gradually
  ### - Pressing the down arrow to duck
  Connecting the event of pressing down on the down arrow key and linking it to change the sprite chracter to
  another image of the character in a different "ducking" pose (changing the animation images)
  ### - Putting sprites it the game that will move/be animated
  Using Pygame to link images in a certain order of a loop to give off the illusion of motion/animation
  ### - Keeping update of a score
  Displaying the text wih pygame in the corner and updating it with correlation to the run time of the game
  up until the character dies
  ### - Death screen popping up when interaction with entity 
  As soon as the sprite charcter interacts with a different sprite, it should end the game and switch it to a 
  new screen by using an if statement. I can use pygame's shapes to make the screen as well.
