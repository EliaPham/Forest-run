### Forest Run
  (https://github.com/EliaPham/Forest-run)

## Description
  The program will run a game in another window where you run on as long as you can without bumping into an object/entity. This relevant to digital arts & media as I will need to create sprites to use in the game, meaning that this project combines both art and coding to make one cohesive game.
